## How can I contribute

### Reporting bugs

If you test the engine and encounter a bug, you can : 
- Check if the issue doesn't already exist on github
- Report it on Github (Specify OS, compiler if you compiled it yourself, version of the engine)
- Discuss it on the Discord (#issues channel)

### Ask for new features

If you feel like there is a missing feature come and discuss it with us on the Discord (#features channel)

### Create new features yourself

You're an adventurer ? Nice ! If you developped something for the engine you can do a pull request, 
I'll try to validate it quickly if everything is in order :)
